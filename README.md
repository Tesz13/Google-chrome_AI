# 🛡️ ScreenGuard AI - Chrome Extension

**Real-Time Privacy Protection Using Chrome's Built-in AI**

ScreenGuard AI is a Chrome extension that automatically detects and blurs personally identifiable information (PII) as it appears on your screen — protecting users from shoulder-surfing, screen-sharing leaks, and accidental exposure during meetings.

Built for the **Google Chrome Built-in AI Challenge 2025** 🏆

## 🎯 How It Works

### 1. AI-Powered Detection

ScreenGuard AI uses Chrome's **Prompt API** with **Gemini Nano** to analyze text content:

```javascript
const session = await ai.languageModel.create({
  systemPrompt: `You are a PII detector. Analyze text and identify 
  personally identifiable information with context awareness...`
});

const piiItems = await session.prompt(`Analyze this text: "${text}"`);
```

### 2. Intelligent Context Awareness

The AI understands context to reduce false positives:

- ✅ "Johns Hopkins University" → **NOT PII** (institution name)
- ❌ "John's email: john@email.com" → **IS PII** (personal email)

### 3. Visual Masking

When PII is detected, the extension:
1. Gets the exact screen position of the text using `Range.getBoundingClientRect()`
2. Creates a positioned overlay element with blur effect
3. Updates overlay positions on scroll/resize

### 4. Regex Fallback

If the AI API is unavailable, the extension automatically falls back to regex-based detection to ensure functionality.

## 🎨 Usage

### Popup Controls

Click the extension icon to:
- **Toggle protection** on/off
- **View PII count** on current page
- **Configure filters** for specific PII types
- **Rescan page** manually
- **Access settings**

### Keyboard Shortcut

- **`Ctrl+Shift+P`** (Windows/Linux)
- **`Cmd+Shift+P`** (Mac)

Quickly toggle PII masking on/off

### Settings Page

Right-click the extension icon → Options:
- Enable/disable specific PII types
- Configure advanced settings
- View extension information

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### Chrome APIs Used

- **Prompt API** (Primary) - AI-powered PII detection with Gemini Nano
- **Storage API** - Save user preferences
- **Tabs API** - Communicate with active tabs
- **Scripting API** - Inject content scripts
- **Commands API** - Keyboard shortcuts

### Performance Optimizations

- **Debounced scanning** - Waits 500ms after DOM changes before rescanning
- **WeakSet for processed nodes** - Prevents duplicate processing
- **Viewport-first scanning** - Prioritizes visible content
- **Efficient text node traversal** - Uses TreeWalker for optimal performance

### Privacy & Security

- ✅ **100% local processing** - No data sent to external servers
- ✅ **No tracking or analytics** - Your privacy is guaranteed
- ✅ **Open source** - Fully auditable code
- ✅ **Minimal permissions** - Only requests necessary permissions

## 🧪 Testing Scenarios

### Test with demo.html

The included `demo.html` contains various PII types for testing:
- Email addresses in different formats
- Phone numbers (US and international)
- SSNs with and without dashes
- Credit card numbers
- API keys and tokens
- Mixed content scenarios
- Context awareness tests

### Test on Real Sites

Try the extension on:
- Gmail (emails, phone numbers in signatures)
- LinkedIn (contact information)
- Google Docs (documents with PII)
- Slack Web (shared contact info)
- Any web form with personal data

## 🛠️ Development

### Adding New PII Types

1. Update the `piiTypes` array in `content.js`
2. Add regex pattern in `regexFallback()` method
3. Update the AI system prompt to include the new type
4. Add filter checkbox in `popup.html` and `options.html`
5. Add color-coded style in `content.css`

### Debugging

Enable verbose logging:
```javascript
// In content.js
console.log('🛡️ ScreenGuard:', message);
```

Check the console:
